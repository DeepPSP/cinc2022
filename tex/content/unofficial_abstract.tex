Aim: This work focuses on the problem of the detection of heart murmurs from phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings raised by the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022. Heart murmur is an important indicator for cardiac pathologies, especially the congenital heart diseases. Its accurate detection helps early clinical intervention of such vital diseases, hence has a significant medical and social value.
