Heart murmur, defined as heart sounds produced by the turbulent blood flow through the heart, is a common clinical indicator in pediatric cardiology \cite{Masic_2018}. Accurate detection of heart murmurs and distinguishment between innocent murmurs and pathological murmurs help early clinical intervention of vital heart diseases such as congenital heart diseases, hence having a significant medical and social value.

Based on such motivations, the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 (CinC2022) \cite{Oliveira_2021_CirCor} raised the question on the usage of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, which are non-invasive heart sound recordings collected from multiple auscultation locations, for detecting heart murmurs and making clinical diagnostic decisions. In this paper, we present our methods of tackling this problem developed during the challenge.
